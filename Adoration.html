    <h1 id="MemorareStJoseph"> Memorare to St Joseph</h1>
    <p>Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Virgin Mary, that never has it been known that anyone who asked for your help and sought your intercession was left unaided. Full of confidence in your power, I hasten to you, and beg your protection. Listen, O foster-father of the Redeemer, to my humble prayer, and in your goodness hear and answer me. Amen.</p>
   

    <h1 id="ProtectionStJoseph">Prayer for the Virtue of Chastity</h1>
      <p>  Saint Joseph, father and guardian of virgins, to whose faithful keeping Christ Jesus, innocence itself, and Mary, the virgin of virgins was entrusted, I pray and beseech you by that twofold and most precious charge, by Jesus and Mary, to save us from all uncleanness, to keep our minds untainted, our hearts pure, and our bodies chaste and to help us to serve Jesus and Mary in perfect chastity. Amen.</p>

    <h1 id="InTimesOfTrouble">Prayer to St. Joseph In Times of Trouble</h1>
      <p>Blessed Joseph, we come to you in our troubles and humbly beg you to help our family in our needs.  Watchful Guardian of the Holy Family, protect us from every worry and difficulty.  As once you rescued the Child Jesus, so now protect us.  Shield  us by your constant care so that we may be able to live with peace of mind and obtain eternal happines.</p>

      <p>Saint Joseph, skilled master of the interior life, teach us to live every moment in the intimate presence of Jesus and Mary, confidently abandoning ourselves to the love of God the Father.</p>

      <p>Saint Joseph, protector of the Holy Family at Nazareth, we entrust to you the future of our families.  May our homes be warmed by hospitality and love.</p>

      <p>Help us to provide a Christian education for our children.</p>

      <p>Saint Joseph, model of workers, we place our daily work in your loving hands that it may contribute to the well-being of everyone.  Help us to do our work in a spirit of service.  We pray too for everyone seeking employment</p>

      <p>Saint Joseph, faithful guradian of the Church, as God once entrusted to your care the mysteries of salvation, so now inspire Christians to be faithful to the Gospel, always and everywhere, in the midst of a world so woefully in search of fellowship, peace and love.  Amen.</p>

      <h1 id="JosephSupportofFamilies">Joseph, Support of Families</h1>

      <p>Dear Saint Joseph, you also have known family life.  Both you and Mary lived as a happy couple by lovingly caring for each other.  Naturally, your mutual love focused on your child, the Sone of God.</p>

      <p>Like us, you were called to intensify your love in the midst of joys and sorrows.</p>

      <p>Kindly protect the members of our family.  Like your Son who knew how to read hearts beyond appearnaces, help us to live in harmony by better understanding one another.</p>

      <p>May neither pride nor selfishness stifle the affection that we have for one another.  Give us the courage to always remain faithful to our family commitments, so that we may all draw closer to the Son of God whose Spirit lives at the heart of a loving family.  Amen.</p>

      <h1 id="Consecration">Consecration to St. Joseph</h1>
      
      <p>O dearest Saint Joseph, I consecrate myself to your honor and give myself to you, that you may always be my father, my protector and my guide in the way of salvation. Obtain for me a greater purity of heart and fervent love of the interior life. After your example may I do all my actions for the greater glory of God, in union with the Divine Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. O Blessed Saint Joseph, pray for me, that I may share in the peace and joy of your holy death. Amen.</p>

    <h1 id="PrayerBeforeWork">Prayer Before Work to St. Joseph the Worker</h1>
      <p>  O Glorious Saint Joseph, model of all those who are devoted to labor, obtain for me the grace to work in a spirit of penance for the expiation of my many sins; to work conscientiously, putting the call of duty above my natural inclinations; to work with thankfulness and joy, considering it an honor to employ and develop by means of labor the gifts received from God; to work with order, peace, moderation, and patience, never shrinking from weariness and trials; to work above all with purity of intention and detachment from self, keeping unceasingly before my eyes death and the account that I must give of time lost, talents unused, good omitted, and vain complacency in success, so fatal to the work of God.</p>

      <p>All for Jesus, all through Mary, all after thy example, O Patriarch, Saint Joseph. Such shall be my watch-word in life and in death. Amen.</p>

      <p>  This precious treasury of prayers in honour of St. Joseph is to be prayed for 30 days, commemorating the earthly thirty years which St. Joseph spent in the company of our Lord. St. Teresa of Avila vouched for its efficaciousness, writing “If you really want to believe in it, prove it to yourself by reciting the Novena and you will be finally convinced.”</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>It takes approximately 20-25 minutes and “the extraordinary graces obtained by this prayer are innumerable“. It is suggested that one be specific in petition, rather than florid and vague. Indeed, listen to Roy Schoeman’s anecdote about the nuns, the potatoes and St. Joseph at the end of his podcast episode from March 2019, linked below.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>This devotion calls upon a special patronage from our glorious patriarch St. Joseph and, in order to warrant such a merit, it is suggested that one make additional offerings for the Holy Souls, for whom this devotion is also particularly helpful. One might, for example, pray the De Profundis daily after the 6:00pm Angelus, and/or the Daily Prayers for the Holy Souls. One could also offer daily the Litany for the Poor Souls.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>It is said that any missed days may be caught up on the 30th day. So if one were to miss 2 days (not recommended), then the prayers in their totality would be recited 3 times on the final day.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p><b>Section I: Prayers</b></p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I give Thee my heart and my soul.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>3x Glory Be *</p>
      <p>(* To the Holy Trinity, giving thanks for having ‘exalted St. Joseph to a position of such exceptional dignity.’) </p>  <p&emsp></p>


      <p>OFFERING I:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, I humbly prostrate myself before Thee. I beg the Lord Jesus, thine Immaculate Spouse, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and Saints in the Heavenly Court, to join me in this devotion. I offer thee this precious cloak, while pledging my sincerest faith and devotion. I promise to do all in my power to honour thee throughout my lifetime to prove my love for thee.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>Help me, St. Joseph. Assist me now and throughout my lifetime, but especially at the moment of my death, as thou wert assisted by Jesus and Mary, that I may join thee one day in Heaven and there honour thee for all eternity. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <b> <p>OFFERING II:</p> </b><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, prostrate, before thee and thy Divine Son, Jesus, I offer thee, with heartfelt devotion, this precious treasury of prayers, being ever mindful of the numerous virtues which adorned thy sacred person. In thee, O Glorious Patriarch, was fulfilled the dream of thy precursor the first Joseph, who indeed seemed to have been sent by God to prepare the way for thy presence on this earth. In fact, not only wert thou surrounded by the shining splendour of the rays of the Divine Sun, Jesus, but thou wert splendidly reflected in the brilliant light of the mystic moon, the Blessed Virgin Mary. O Glorious Patriarch, if the example of the ancient Jacob, who personally went to congratulate his favourite son, who was exalted on the throne of Egypt, served to bring all his progeny there, should not the example of Jesus and Mary, who honoured thee with their greatest respect and trust, serve to bring me, thy devoted servant, to present thee with this precious cloak in thy honour.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Grant, O Great St. Joseph, that the Almighty God may turn a benevolent glance toward me. As the ancient Joseph did not reject his guilty and cruel brothers, but rather accepted them with love and protected and saved them from hunger and death, I beseech thee, O Glorious Patriarch, through thine intercession, grant that the Lord may never abandon me in this exiled valley of sorrows. Grant that He may always number me as one of thy devoted servants who dost live serenely under the patronage of thy Holy Cloak. Grant that I may live always within the protection of this patronage, every day of my life and particularly at that moment when I draw my dying breath. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••</p><p>&nbsp</p>
     <p>PRAYER I:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Hail O Glorious St. Joseph, thou who art entrusted with the priceless treasures of heaven and earth and foster-father of Him Who doth nourish all the creatures of the universe. Thou art, after Mary, the Saint most worthy of our love and devotion. Thou alone, above all the Saints, wert chosen for that supreme honour of rearing, guiding, nourishing and even embracing the Messiah, Whom so many kings and prophets would have so desired to behold.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>St. Joseph, save my soul and obtain for me from the Divine Mercy of God that petition for which I humbly pray.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>And for the Holy Souls in Purgatory, grant a great comfort from their pain. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>3x Glory Be * </p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••</p>
     <p>PRAYER II:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>O powerful St. Joseph, thou wert proclaimed the Patron of the Universal Church, therefore, I invoke thee, above all the other Saints, as the greatest protector of the afflicted, and I offer countless blessings to thy most generous heart, always ready to help in any need.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>To thee, O Glorious St. Joseph, come the widows, the orphans, the abandoned, the afflicted, the oppressed. There is no sorrow, heartache or anguish which thou hast not consoled. Deign, I beseech thee, to use on my behalf those gifts which God hast given thee, until I too shall be granted the answer to my petition. And thou, Holy Souls in Purgatory, pray to St. Joseph for me. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>3x Glory Be *</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••<p>
     <p>PRAYER III:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Countless are those who have prayed to thee before me and have received comfort and peace, graces and favours. My heart, so sad and sorrowful, cannot find rest in the midst of this trial which besets me. O Glorious St. Joseph, thou knowest all my needs even before I set them forth in prayer. Thou knowest how important this petition is for me. I prostrate myself before thee as I sigh under the heavy weight of the problem which confronts me.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>There is no human heart in which I can confide my sorrow; and even if I should find a compassionate creature who would be willing to assist me, still he would be unable to help me. Only thou can help me in my sorrow, St. Joseph, and I beg thee to hear my plea.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Has not St. Teresa left it written in her dialogues that the world may always know “Whatever you ask of St. Joseph, you shall receive.”</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>O St. Joseph, comforter of the afflicted, have pity on my sorrow and pity on those Poor Souls who place so much hope in their prayers to thee. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>3x Glory Be *</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••</p>
     <p>PRAYER IV:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>O Sublime Patriarch St. Joseph, because of thy perfect obedience to God, thou mayest intercede for me.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>For thy holy life full of grace and merit, hear my prayer.</p>
     <p>For thy most sweet name, help me.</p>
     <p>For thy most holy tears, comfort me.</p>
     <p>For thy seven sorrows, intercede for me.</p>
     <p>For thy seven joys, console me.</p>
     <p>From all harm of body and soul, deliver me.</p>
     <p>From all danger and disaster, save me.</p>

     <p>Assist me with thy powerful intercession and seek for me, through thy power and mercy, all that is necessary for my salvation and particularly the favour of which I now stand in such great need. Amen.<p>

     <p>3x Glory Be *</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••</p>
     <p>PRAYER V:</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>O Glorious St. Joseph, countless are the graces and favours which thou hast obtained for afflicted souls. Illness of every nature, those who are oppressed, persecuted, betrayed, bereft of all human comfort, even those in need of their life bread — all who imploreth thy powerful intercession are comforted in their affliction.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Do not permit, O dearest St. Joseph, that I alone be the only one of all who hast appealed to thee, to be denied this petition which I so earnestly beg of thee. Show thy kindness and generosity even to me, that I may cry out in thanksgiving, “Eternal glory to our Holy Patriarch St. Joseph, my great protector on earth and the defender of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.” Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>3x Glory Be *</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>•••••••</p>
     <p>PRAYER VI:</p>

     <p>Eternal Father, Who art in Heaven, through the merits of Jesus and Mary, I beg Thee to grant my petition. In the name of Jesus and Mary I prostrate myself before Thy Divine presence and I beseech Thee to accept my hopeful plea to persevere in my prayers that I may be numbered among the throngs of those who live under the patronage of St. Joseph.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>Extend Thy blessing on this precious treasury of prayers which I today offer to him as a pledge of my devotion. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>i) Remember O most chaste spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, my good protector St. Joseph, that never was it known that anyone who came to thy protection, and sought thy intercession was left unaided. Confidently I prostrate myself before thee and fervently beg for thy powerful intervention. O foster-Father of our dear Redeemer, despise not my petition, but in thy mercy, hear and answer me. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

     <p>ii) Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary and virginal father of Jesus, look upon me and watch over me; lead me on the path of sanctifying grace; take heed of the urgent needs which I now beg thee to envelop within the folds of thy fatherly cloak. Dismiss those obstacles and difficulties standing in the way of my prayer and grant that the happy answer to my petition may serve for the greater glory of God and my eternal salvation. As a pledge of my undying gratitude, I promise to spread the word of thy glory while offering thanks to the Lord for having so blessed thy power and might in heaven and earth. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>&nbsp</p>
      <p>Let Us Pray</p><p>&nbsp</p>
      <p>O God, Who in Thine ineffable Providence didst vouchsafe to choose Blessed Joseph to be the spouse of Thy most holy Mother, grant, we beseech Thee, that he whom we venerate as our protector on earth may be our intercessor in Heaven. Who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>Section V: Closing Prayer of the Holy Cloak</p><p>&nbsp</p>
      <p>O Glorious Patriarch St. Joseph, thou who wert chosen by God above all men to be the earthly head of the most holy of families, I beseech thee to accept me within the folds of thy holy cloak, that thou mayest become the guardian and custodian of my soul.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>From this moment on, I choose thee as my father, my protector, my counselor, my patron and I beseech thee to place in thy custody my body, my soul, all that I am, all that I possess, my life and my death.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

      <p>Look upon me as one of thy children; defend me from the treachery of my enemies, invisible or otherwise, assist me at all times in all my necessities; console me in the bitterness of my life, and especially at the hour of my death. Say but one word for me to the Divine Redeemer Whom thou wert deemed worthy to hold in thine arms, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary, thy most chaste spouse. Request for me those blessings which will lead me to salvation. Include me amongst those who art most dear to thee and I shall set forth to prove myself worthy of thy special patronage. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>



      <h1 id="RosarySt.Joseph">Rosary of St. Joseph</h1><p&emsp></p>

      <p>Using the regular rosary beads . . .</p>

      <p>On the crucifix</p>

      <p> O Lord, in order to honor St. Joseph as he deserves, Thou hast taken him body and soul to Heaven to Crown him with glory, thus signifying to the world, both visible and invisible, that Thou hast made Joseph Thy foster-father, the supreme steward of all Thy possessions.</p>

      <p>After saying the above prayer, skip to the large bead and say the following prayer, which will be said on each of the large beads.</p>

      <p>We beseech Thee, O Lord, that we may find aid in the merits of the Spouse of Thy Most Holy Mother, so that what we cannot obtain by ourselves may be given us through his intercession, who livest and reignest with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.</p>

      <p>For each decade of small beads, it is customary to meditate on events in the life of Joseph, similar to what the Oblates of St. Joseph list on their website.</p>

      <p>1. Betrothal to Mary (Mt 1:18). </p>
      <p>2. Annunciation to Joseph (Mt 1:19-21). </p>
      <p>3. Birth and Naming of Jesus (Mt 1:22-25). </p>
      <p>4. Flight into Egypt (Mt 2:13-15). </p>
      <p>5. Hidden Life at Nazareth (Mt 2:23; Lk 2:51-52). </p>


      <p>Other mysteries that can be substituted for these mysteries are the “Finding of Jesus in the Temple,” the “Death of St. Joseph” and the “Coronation of St. Joseph in Heaven.”</p>


      <p>On each small bead the following prayer is recited.</p>

      <p>Hail Joseph, Son of David, thou whose holiness surpasses that of all Angels and Saints, blessed art thou amongst men, thou who wert chosen to be the Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary of whom was born Jesus.</p>

      <p>Glorious Saint Joseph, now reigning body and soul in Heaven, protector of the Universal Church, pray for us poor sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

      <p>Similar to the typical Rosary, each decade is completed with a “Glory Be.”</p>
