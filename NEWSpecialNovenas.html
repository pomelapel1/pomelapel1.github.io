    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Pray the Psalm 23 </p><p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> <b>Psalm 65 – Thanksgiving for the Lord's Blessings </p></b>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 1Praise awaits You, our God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 2You who answer prayers, to you all people will come. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 3When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 4Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 5You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> God our Savior,the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 6who formed the mountains by your power,  having armed yourself with strength, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 7who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 8The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 9You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly.   </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> for so you have ordained it.   </p>
   
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 10You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 11You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 12The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 13The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing! </p> <p>&nbsp</p>  <p&emsp></p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Psalm 126 - Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 1 When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> We were like those who dream. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> And our tongue with joyful shouting;  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Then they said among the nations, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> "The LORD has done great things for them." </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 3 The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 4 Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 5 Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 6 He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy,  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> bringing his sheaves with him. </p>

    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">  <b>Holy Spirit, </b>you who make us see everything and show us the way to reach our ideals. You who give us the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to us and you who are in all instances of our lives with us.  In this short dialogue, we want to thank you for everything, and confirm once more that we never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. We want to be with you and our loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> <b>Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help</b> </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that we may ever invoke your powerful name, the protection of the living and the salvation of the dying. O Purest Mary! O sweetest Mary! let your name henceforth be ever on our lips. Delay not, Blessed Lady, to succour us whenever we call on you. In all our temptations, in all our needs, we will never cease to call on you, ever repeating your sacred name, Mary, Mary. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh what a consolation, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fill our souls when we utter your sacred name or even only think of you! We thank the Lord for having given you so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But we will not be content with merely uttering your name. Let our love for you prompt us ever to hail you Mother of Perpetual 
    Help. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for us and grant us the favor we confidently ask of you (mention request here). </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Hail Mary (3x) </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:black;"> When needing an answer to prayers quickly and without delay, Mother Teresa of Calcutta famously prayed a “Flying” novena. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> This is a simple and quick way to pray a ‘novena’ when you don’t have the full nine days! How do you pray this novena?  Well, Mother Teresa would pray the, <b>Memorare prayer nine times in a row </b> rather than praying it once a day for 9 days.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">  Her religious sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, continue this practice today. Of course, you can pray it either way. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <h3 id="StJude">Prayer to Saint Jude, Help of the Hopeless</h3>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Most holy apostle Saint Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the Church honors and invokes you universally as the patron of difficult cases and problems almost despaired of, pray for us, for we are so helpless and alone. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Intercede with God for us that He brings visible and speedy help where help is most needed. Come to our assistance in this great need that we may receive the consolation and help of heaven in all our necessities, tribulations, and sufferings, particularly (State Your Request), that we may praise God with you and all the saints forever. We promise, O Blessed Saint Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor granted to us  by God and to always honor you as our special and powerful patron, and to gratefully encourage devotion to you. Amen. </p>
    

    <h3 id="StRita">Prayer to Saint Rita for Hopeless Cases and In Distress</h3>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O Holy Patroness of those in need, St. Rita, whose pleadings before thy Divine Lord are almost irresistible, who for thy lavishness in granting favors hast been called the Advocate of the Hopeless and even of the Impossible; St. Rita, so humble, so pure, so mortified, so patient and of such compassionate love for thy Crucified Jesus that thou couldst obtain from Him whatsoever thou askest, on account of which all confidently have recourse to thee expecting, if not always relief, at least comfort; be propitious to our petition, showing thy power with God on behalf of thy suppliant; be lavish to us, as thou hast been in so many wonderful cases, for the greater glory of God, for the spreading of thine own devotion, and for the consolation of those who trust in thee.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O holy protectress of those who art in greatest need, thou who shineth as a star of hope in the midst of darkness, blessed Saint Rita, bright mirror of God's grace, in patience and fortitude thou art a model of all the states in life.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> We unite our will with the will of God through the merits of our Savior Jesus Christ, and in particular through his patient wearing of the crown of thorns, which with tender devotion thou didst daily contemplate.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Through the merits of the holy Virgin Mary and thine own graces and virtues, We ask thee to obtain our earnest petition, provided it be for the greater glory of God and my own sanctification.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Guide and purify my intention, O holy protectress and advocate, so that I may obtain the pardon of all my sins and the grace to persevere daily, as thou didst in walking with courage, generosity, and fidelity down the path of life. [Mention 
your request.] </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> We promise, if our petition is granted, to glorify thee by making known thy favor, to bless and sing thy praises forever. Relying then upon thy merits and power before the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we pray thee grant that [here mention your request]. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Saint Rita, advocate of the impossible, pray for us.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Saint Rita, advocate of the helpless, pray for us. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Recite the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be three times each. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the singular merits of thy childhood, Obtain for us our request.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy perfect union with the Divine Will, Obtain for us our request. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy heroic sufferings during thy married life, Etc. [repeat Obtain for us our request after each line] </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the consolation thou didst experience at the conversion of thy husband, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the sacrifice of thy children rather than see them grievously offend God,</p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the miraculous entrance into the convent, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy severe penances and thrice daily bloody scourgings,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the suffering caused by the wound thou didst receive from the thorn of thy Crucified Savior, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the Divine love which consumed thy heart, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By that remarkable devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, on which alone thou didst exist for four years, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the happiness with which thou didst part from thy trials to join thy Divine Spouse,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the perfect example thou gavest to people of every state of life.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Pray for us, O holy St. Rita, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> LET US PRAY. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O God, Who in Thine infinite tenderness hast vouchsafed to regard the prayer of Thy servant, Blessed Rita, and dost grant to her supplication that which is impossible to human foresight, skill and efforts, in reward of her compassionate love and firm reliance on Thy promise, have pity on our adversity and succor us in our calamities, that the unbeliever may know Thou art the recompense of the humble, the defense of the helpless, and the strength of those who trust in Thee, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Good Saint Dymphna, great wonder-worker in every affliction of mind and body, I humbly implore your powerful intercession with Jesus through Mary, the Health of the Sick, in my present need.

    <p style="color:red;"><b>O HOLY SPIRIT,</b> Third Person of the Blessed Trinity! Spirit of Truth, Love and Holiness, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and equal to Them in all things!

    <p style="color:red;"> <b>ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT </b></p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> On our knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, we offer ourselves, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. We adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength and Light of our soul. In You we live and move and are. We desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and we pray with all our hearts to be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard our every thought and grant that we may always watch for Your light, and listen to Your voice, and follow Your gracious inspirations. We cling to You and give ourselves to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over us in our weakness.

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> <b>Virgin Mary, Untier of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:Dodgerblue;"> Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will, and the Devil was never capable to tie you around with his confusion. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and, full of kindness and patience you gave us example of how to untie the knots of our life. And by remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order, and make clearer the ties that link us to the Lord. Holy Mother, Mother of God, and our Mother, to you, who untie with motherly heart the knots of our life, we pray to you to receive in your hands </p>
    <p style="color:DarkBlue;"> (Our family here and abroad, our elderly, our livelihood, our health , the children, my nieces and nephews & their studies, their choices, perspectives, chastity, purity, holiness,  their friends and all of the youth & young adults.  Save the children, Lord.  Save the children!  Don't let the grip of Satan, destroy them!  We also pray  for the conversion of sinners, to end war, sick & the dying, souls in purgatory of our parents, grandparents down to the first generation, relatives & most especially those who have been forgotten and stayed there the longest. . . ),  </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> and to free them of the knots and confusion with which our enemies attack. Through your grace, your intercession, and your example, deliver us from all evil, Our Lady, and untie the knots that prevent us from being tied with God, so that we, free from sin and error, may find Him in all things, may have our hearts placed in Him, and may serve Him always in our brothers and sisters. Amen.   </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><b> Prayer to Mary, Undoer of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exist in your heart, cast your compassionate eyes upon us and see the snarl of knots that exists in our life. You know very well how desperate we are, our pain, and how we are bound by these knots. Mary, Mother to whom God entrusted the undoing of the knots in the lives of his children, we entrust into your hands the ribbon of our life. No one, not even the evil one himself, can take it away from your precious care. In your hands there is no knot that cannot be undone. Powerful Mother, by your grace and intercessory power with Your Son and our Liberator, Jesus, take into your hands today this knot (mention your request) </p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> I beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all. You are our hope. O our Lady, you are the only consolation God gives me, the fortification of our feeble strength, the enrichment of our destitution, and, with Christ, the freedom from our chains. Hear our plea. Keep me, guide me, protect me, O safe refuge! </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Amen.  </p><p>&nbsp</p>


    <p style="color:teal;"> <b>Prayer to St. Joseph over 1900 years old </b></p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> O St. Joseph whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the Throne of God, we place in you all our interests and desires. O St. Joseph do assist us by your powerful intercession and obtain for us from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, Our Lord; so that having engaged here below your Heavenly power, we may offer our thanksgiving and homage to the Loving of Fathers. O St. Joseph, we never weary of contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms. We dare not approach you while He reposes near your heart. Press him in our name and kiss His fine Head for me, and ask Him to return the kiss when we draw our dying breath. St. Joseph, Patron of departing souls, pray for us. Amen </p> <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Say for nine consecutive mornings for anything you may desire. It has seldom been known to fail. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Virgin Mary, that never has it been known that anyone who asked for your help and sought your intercession was left unaided. Full of confidence in your power, I hasten to you, and beg your protection. Listen, O foster-father of the Redeemer, to my humble prayer, and in your goodness hear and answer me. Amen. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Saint Joseph, father and guardian of virgins, to whose faithful keeping Christ Jesus, innocence itself, and Mary, the virgin of virgins was entrusted, I pray and beseech you by that twofold and most precious charge, by Jesus and Mary, to save us from all uncleanness, to keep our minds untainted, our hearts pure, and our bodies chaste and to help us to serve Jesus and Mary in perfect chastity.

As the nail held my feet together, so it held all my people to become one. My children, whenever you say this prayer you are making the hour of My Kingdom on earth come sooner. Through this prayer, My Father will let it come down soon; the hour of the Second Pentecost when My prayer will be fulfilled that all shall be one... All who carry out this devotion will rejoice greatly when My Kingdom comes. I will protect them always.
Eternal Father, I offer You all the wounds, pains, and the Precious Blood from the sacred feet of Your Son, Our Lord and Master, for all Your children who are wandering like sheep without a shepherd in this terrifying forest. Protect them against wild predators and give them peace that they might be one and united in the same way as the nail held fast the feet of my Master and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. Precious Blood of Jesus Christ - reign forever. Amen </p>

All who break a covenant and are supposed to die shall be saved and also be released from their curse if they constantly say this prayer and repent. My children, how terrible will it be to fall into God's anger! Turn from your sins and live. I love you all. Be healed.
Eternal Father, You are the only Immortal God, God Who is love, merciful and kind. Look at Your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and have mercy. I offer You the pains of His scourging at the pillar, His wounds and blood, for all Your people who are under the weight of the curse due to the sins of their ancestors and their disobedience for breaking the covenant they made with You. May You set us free through the scourging of Your Son, heal us through His wounds and save us through His Precious Blood. Amen. Precious Blood of Jesus Christ - release us from curses. Holy wounds of Jesus Christ - heal our wounds. By Your scourging - seal us. Amen.  </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Today the blood of innocent children has filled heaven. Their number is too great, too great . . . the wrath of the Eternal Father is about to fall on mankind...Their blood disturbs My Agonizing Heart and increases My agony...Through this prayer, large numbers of innocent unborn babies will be saved. Pray it daily and make it known to the world. Anyone who teaches it will not be lost. Innocent souls in heaven will not let them become lost. I, with My Love and Mercy, will protect them from falling into mortal sin.
Heavenly Father, Your love is eternal. In Your ocean of love, You saved the world through Your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Now look at Your only Son on the Cross Who is constantly bleeding for love of His people, and forgive Your world. Purify and baptize aborted children with the Precious Blood and water from the Sacred Side of Your Son, Jesus Christ, Who hung dead on the Cross for their salvation; in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. May they, through the holy death of Jesus Christ, gain everlasting life, through His wounds be healed and through His Precious Blood be freed. There to rejoice with the saints in heaven.

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Pray much for My youth . . . many will be lost due to (this) sin . . . I was naked in the sight of all men so that you shall defeat and kill the desires of the flesh which lead to this sin of fornication and adultery. Children, My adversary used this sin to claim all men to himself...Any sinner who constantly prays this prayer will gain true repentance...The more you pray it, the more (souls) will return to me and leave fornication and adultery. Many people will be lost due to the sins of the flesh. Work hard to save souls...

Holy and merciful Father, Your only- begotten Son is standing naked in the sight of all men, so that Your people will know and fear Your holy law. Accept my humble prayer for all Your people who are living under iniquity, fornication and adultery, that through all the shame and disgrace of Your only-begotten Son, You will touch their lives for repentance and save them. May they, through the Precious Blood of Your Son Jesus Christ, which I plead to fall on their hearts, gain repentance and be saved. Through His shame make them bold for repentance. Amen. </p>

For the sake of my child’s soul, I pray to understand and trust in this.  St. Monica, please teach me to persist in faithful prayer as you did for your son’s sake.  </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> The Gift of Fear </p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> The gift of Fear fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and 
makes us dread nothing so much as to offend Him by sin. It is a
fear that arises, not from the thought of hell, but from 
sentiments of reverence and filial submission to our heavenly 
Father. It is the fear that is the beginning of wisdom, detaching 
us from worldly pleasures that could in any way separate us 
from God. "They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and
in His sight will sanctify their souls."  </p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
	
	
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Prayer -  Come, O blessed Spirit of Holy Fear, penetrate our inmost heart,
that we may set you, our Lord and God, before our face forever,
help us to shun all things that can offend You, and make us 
worthy to appear before the pure eyes of Your Divine Majesty in 
heaven, where You live and reign in the unity of the ever 
Blessed Trinity, God world without end. Amen.

    <p style="color:darkblue;">Mary, Beloved Mother, channel of all grace, we return to You 
today our heart, recognizing that we are a sinner in need of 
your help. Many times we lose the graces you grant us because 
of our sins of egoism, pride, rancor and our lack of generosity 
and humility. we turn to You today, Mary, Undoer of knots, for 
You to ask your Son Jesus to grant us a pure, divested, humble 
and trusting heart. we will live today practicing these virtues 
and offering you this as a sign of our love for You. we entrust 
into Your hands this knot [Our family here and abroad, our 
elderly, our livelihood, our health , the children & their 
studies, their choices, perspectives, chastity, purity, 
holiness, & my nieces nephews, their friends and all of 
the youth & the dying, for world peace, for all the souls in
purgatory and conversion of sinners . . . ] which keeps us 
from reflecting the glory of God. </p>

    <p style="color:red;">Day 2 Souls of priests and religious  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;">Today bring to ME the souls of priests and religious, and
immerse them in MY unfathomable mercy. It was they who
gave ME the strength to endure MY bitter Passion. Through
them, as through channels, MY mercy flows out upon mankind.
Most Merciful Jesus, from whom comes all that is good, increase
Your grace in us, that we may perform worthy works of mercy,
and that all who see us may glorify the Father of Mercy who is in
heaven.
The fountain of God's love,
Dwells in pure hearts,
Bathed on the Sea of Mercy,
Radiant as stars, bright as the dawn.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the company (of
chosen ones) in Your vineyard - upon the souls of priests and
religious; and endow them with the strength of Your blessing.
For the love of the Heart of Your Son, in which they are
enfolded, impart to them Your power and light, that they may
be able to guide others in the way of salvation, and with one
voice sing praise to Your boundless mercy for ages without end.
Amen. </p>

forgiveness, God the Father, for our sin. Help us now to forgive all the 
persons who consciously or unconsciously provoked this knot. Give me, 
also, the grace to forgive ourselves for having provoked this knot. Only in 
this way can You undo it. Before You, dearest Mother, and in the name of 
Your Son Jesus, our Savior, who has suffered so many offenses, having

them in the ocean of MY mercy. These souls brought us
consolation on the Way of the Cross. They were that drop of
consolation in the midst of an ocean of bitterness.
Most Merciful Jesus, from the treasury of Your mercy, You
impart Your graces in great abundance to each and all. Receive
us into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart and never
let us escape from It. We beg this of You by that most
wondrous love for the heavenly Father with which Your Heart
burns so fiercely.
The miracles of mercy are impenetrable,
Neither the sinner nor just one will fathom them,
When you cast upon us an eye of pity,
You draw us all closer to Your love.
Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon faithful souls, as
upon the inheritance of Your Son. For the sake of His sorrowful
Passion, grant them Your blessing and surround them with Your
constant protection. Thus may they never fail in love or lose the
treasure of the holy faith, but rather, with all the hosts of Angels
and Saints, may they glorify Your boundless mercy for endless
ages. Amen. ( </p>
