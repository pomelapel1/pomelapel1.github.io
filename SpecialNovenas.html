    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Pray the Psalm 23 </p><p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> <b>Psalm 65 – Thanksgiving for the Lord's Blessings </p></b>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 1Praise awaits You, our God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 2You who answer prayers, to you all people will come. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 3When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 4Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 5You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> God our Savior,the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 6who formed the mountains by your power,  having armed yourself with strength, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 7who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 8The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 9You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly.   </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> for so you have ordained it.   </p>
   
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 10You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 11You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 12The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 13The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing! </p> <p>&nbsp</p>  <p&emsp></p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Psalm 126 - Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 1 When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> We were like those who dream. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> And our tongue with joyful shouting;  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Then they said among the nations, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> "The LORD has done great things for them." </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 3 The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 4 Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 5 Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 6 He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy,  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> bringing his sheaves with him. </p>

    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">  <b>Holy Spirit, </b>you who make me see everything and show me the way to reach my ideals. You who give me the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to me and you who are in all instances of my life with me.  I, in this short dialogue want to thank you for everything, and confirm once more that I never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. I want to be with you and my loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> <b>Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help</b> </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that I may ever invoke your powerful name, the protection of the living and the salvation of the dying. O Purest Mary! O sweetest Mary! let your name henceforth be ever on my lips. Delay not, Blessed Lady, to succour me whenever I call on you. In all my temptations, in all my needs, I will never cease to call on you, ever repeating your sacred name, Mary, Mary. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh what a consolation, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fills my soul when I utter your sacred name or even only think of you! I thank the Lord for having given you so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But I will not be content with merely uttering your name. Let my love for you prompt me ever to hail you Mother of Perpetual 
    Help. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for me and grant me the favor I confidently ask of you (mention request here). </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Hail Mary (3x) </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:black;"> When needing an answer to prayers quickly and without delay, Mother Teresa of Calcutta famously prayed a “Flying” novena. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> This is a simple and quick way to pray a ‘novena’ when you don’t have the full nine days! How do you pray this novena?  Well, Mother Teresa would pray the, <b>Memorare prayer nine times in a row </b> rather than praying it once a day for 9 days.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">  Her religious sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, continue this practice today. Of course, you can pray it either way. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;"><b>O HOLY SPIRIT,</b> Third Person of the Blessed Trinity! Spirit of Truth, Love and Holiness, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and equal to Them in all things!

Give us the four Cardinal Virtues, thy Seven Gifts and twelve Fruits.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">Make us a faithful follower of Jesus and an obedient child of the Church.  Give  us  the grace to keep the commandments and to receive the sacraments worthily.  Raise us to perfection the state of life to which Thou hast called us, and lead us through a happy death, to everlasting life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">Grant us also, O Holy Spirit, Thou who are the giver of all good gifts, the special favour for which we ask (name it), if it be for Thy greater honour and glory and the good of our souls.  Amen.  . . . Glory be to the Father (3 times)</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;"> <b>ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT </b></p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> On our knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, we offer myself, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. we adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength and Light of our soul. In You we live and move and am. we desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and we pray with all our heart to be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard our every thought and grant that we may always watch for Your light, and listen to Your voice, and follow Your gracious inspirations. we cling to You and give ourselves to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over us in our weakness. Holding the pierced Feet of Jesus and looking at His Five Wounds, and trusting in His Precious Blood and adoring His opened Side and stricken Heart, we implore You, Adorable Spirit, Helper of our infirmity, to keep us in Your grace that we may never sin against You. Give us grace, O Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father and the Son to say to You always and everywhere, "Speak Lord for Your servant heareth." Amen  </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> O Lord Jesus Christ, Who, before ascending into heaven, did promise to send the Holy Spirit to finish Your work in the souls of Your Apostles and Disciples, deign to grant the same Holy Spirit to us that He may perfect in our soul, the work of Your grace and Your love. Grant us the Spirit of Wisdom that we may despise the perishable things of this world and aspire only after the things that are eternal, the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten our mind with the light of Your divine truth, the Spirit of Counsel that we may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God and gaining heaven, the Spirit of Fortitude that we may bear our cross with You and that we may overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose our salvation, the Spirit of Knowledge that we may know God and know ourselves and grow perfect in the science of the Saints, the Spirit of Piety that we may find the service of God sweet and amiable, and the Spirit of Fear that we may be filled with a loving reverence towards God and may dread in any way to displease Him. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your true disciples and animate us in all things with Your Spirit. Amen. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> <b>Virgin Mary, Untier of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will, and the Devil was never capable to tie you around with his confusion. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and, full of kindness and patience you gave us example of how to untie the knots of our life. And by remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order, and make clearer the ties that link us to the Lord. Holy Mother, Mother of God, and our Mother, to you, who untie with motherly heart the knots of our life, we pray to you to receive in your hands </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> (Our family here and abroad, our elderly, our livelihood, our health , the children & their studies, their choices, perspectives, chastity, purity, holiness, & my nieces, nephews, their friends and all of the youth & young adults, for conversion of sinners, to end war, sick & the dying, souls in purgatory of our parents, grandparents down to the first generation, relatives & most especially those who have been forgotten and stayed there the longest. . . ),  </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> and to free them of the knots and confusion with which our enemies attack. Through your grace, your intercession, and your example, deliver us from all evil, Our Lady, and untie the knots that prevent us from being tied with God, so that we, free from sin and error, may find Him in all things, may have our hearts placed in Him, and may serve Him always in our brothers and sisters. Amen.   </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><b> Prayer to Mary, Undoer of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exist in your heart, cast your compassionate eyes upon us and see the snarl of knots that exists in our life. You know very well how desperate we are, our pain, and how we are bound by these knots. Mary, Mother to whom God entrusted the undoing of the knots in the lives of his children, we entrust into your hands the ribbon of our life. No one, not even the evil one himself, can take it away from your precious care. In your hands there is no knot that cannot be undone. Powerful Mother, by your grace and intercessory power with Your Son and our Liberator, Jesus, take into your hands today this knot (mention your request) </p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> I beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all. You are our hope. O our Lady, you are the only consolation God gives me, the fortification of our feeble strength, the enrichment of our destitution, and, with Christ, the freedom from our chains. Hear our plea. Keep me, guide me, protect me, O safe refuge! </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Amen.  </p>
