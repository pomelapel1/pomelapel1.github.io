    <h1 id="OpeningPrayer">Opening Prayer</h1>
    <p>Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Thy faithful and enkindle in them the fire of Thy love!</p>
    <p>Send forth Thy Spirit and Thou shall be created.  And Thou shall renew the face of the earth.</p>


    <h1 id="OpeningStJoseph">Opening Prayer to St. Joseph</h1>
      <p>  Saint Joseph, father and guardian of virgins, to whose faithful keeping,  Christ Jesus, innocence itself, and Mary, the virgin of virgins was entrusted, I pray and beseech you by that twofold and most precious charge, by Jesus and Mary, to save us from all uncleanness, to keep our minds untainted, our hearts pure, and our bodies chaste and to keep our minds untainted</p>

    <h1 id="TheHolyRosary">The Holy Rosary</h1>
    <p></p>
  

     <h1 id="StGertrude">St. Gertrude Prayer </h1>
      <p>  Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Most Precious Blood of Thy Divine Son, Jesus, in union with the masses said throughout the world today, for all the holy souls in purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners in the universal church, those in my own home and within my family.  Amen.  </p>  

     <h1 id="Litany">The Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>
    <p></p>
    

    <h1 id="Memorare">The Memorare </h1>
      <p>  Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided. </p>

      <p>Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.  Amen.  </p>   

    <h1 id="Fatima_Prayer">Fatima Prayers </h1>
      <p>  My God, I believe, I adore, I hope and I love Thee! I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love Thee.  </p>
      <p>Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—I adore Thee profoundly. I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges, and indifferences whereby He is offended. And through the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners. </p>  
      <p>O My Jesus, it is  for the  love of Thee, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for the sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.</p> 

    <h1 id="ClosingStJoseph">Closing Prayer to St. Joseph </h1>
      <p>Oh St. Joseph whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires. Oh St. Joseph do assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your divine son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, our Lord; so that having engaged here below your heavenly power I may offer my thanksgiving and homage to the most loving of fathers. Oh St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms. I dare not approach while he reposes near your heart. Press him in my name and kiss his fine head for me, and ask him to return the kiss when I draw my dying breath. St. Joseph, patron of departing souls, pray for us.  Amen.</p>

    <h1 id="ActofContrition">Act of Contrition</h1>
    <p>O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishments, but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
    </p>  
    
    <h1 id="SevenSorrows">The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Mother</h1>
    <p> 1. I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.</p>

    <p>2. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.</p>
  
    <p>3. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.</p>

    <p>4. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.</p>

    <p>5. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.</p>

    <p>6. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.  </p>

    <p>7. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.</p>
