    <p style="color:red;">  <b>O  Holy Spirit, </b>you who make us see everything and show us the way to reach our ideals. You who give us the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to us and you who are in all instances of our lives with us.  In this short dialogue, we want to thank you for everything, and confirm once more that we never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. We want to be with you and our loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;"><b>O HOLY SPIRIT,</b> Third Person of the Blessed Trinity! Spirit of Truth, Love and Holiness, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and equal to Them in all things!  We adore Thee and love Thee with all our hearts.  Teach us to know and to seek God, by whom and for whom we were created.  Fill our hearts with Holy Fear and Love o God.  Grant us compassion and patience, and suffer us not to fall into sin.  Give us an increase of Faith, Hope and Charity, and bring forth in my soul all the virtues proper to my state of life.  Give us the four Cardinal Virtues, thy Seven Gifts and twelve Fruits.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">Make us a faithful follower of Jesus and an obedient child of the Church.  Give  us  the grace to keep the commandments and to receive the sacraments worthily.  Raise us to perfection the state of life to which Thou hast called us, and lead us through a happy death, to everlasting life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">Grant us also, O Holy Spirit, Thou who are the giver of all good gifts, the special favour for which we ask (name it), if it be for Thy greater honour and glory and the good of our souls.  Amen.  . . . Glory be to the Father (3 times)</p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> <b>Holy Spirit, </b> you who make us see everything and show us the way to reach my ideals. You who give us the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to us and you who are in all instances of our lives with us.  In this short dialogue, we want to thank you for everything, and confirm once  more that we never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. We want to be with you and our loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p> <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;"> <b>ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT </b></p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> On our knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, we offer ourselves, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. We adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength and Light of our soul. In You we live and move and are. We desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and we pray with all our hearts to be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard our every thought and grant that we may always watch for Your light, and listen to Your voice, and follow Your gracious inspirations. We cling to You and give ourselves to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over us in our weakness. Holding the pierced Feet of Jesus and looking at His Five Wounds, and trusting in His Precious Blood and adoring His opened Side and stricken Heart, we implore You, Adorable Spirit, Helper of our infirmity, to keep us in Your grace that we may never sin against You. Give us grace, O Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father and the Son to say to You always and everywhere, "Speak Lord for Your servant heareth." Amen  </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> O Lord Jesus Christ, Who, before ascending into heaven, did promise to send the Holy Spirit to finish Your work in the souls of Your Apostles and Disciples, deign to grant the same Holy Spirit to us that He may perfect in our soul, the work of Your grace and Your love. Grant us the Spirit of Wisdom that we may despise the perishable things of this world and aspire only after the things that are eternal, the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten our mind with the light of Your divine truth, the Spirit of Counsel that we may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God and gaining heaven, the Spirit of Fortitude that we may bear our cross with You and that we may overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose our salvation, the Spirit of Knowledge that we may know God and know ourselves and grow perfect in the science of the Saints, the Spirit of Piety that we may find the service of God sweet and amiable, and the Spirit of Fear that we may be filled with a loving reverence towards God and may dread in any way to displease Him. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your true disciples and animate us in all things with Your Spirit. Amen. </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
