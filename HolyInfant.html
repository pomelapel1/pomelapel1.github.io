      <p>Santo Nino Hymn</p>

    <p> One day to these Islands, as gift and in pledge; God sent you to us, Oh beloved Child; And always you have been, the light of our souls; The guide of our people, the flame in our hearts. </p>
    <p> Chorus:  Senor Santo Nino, with your scepter guide our people, Who hail you king forever; the World is your Kingdom. Senor Santo Nino, in Your hands the world find its resting; Proclaim your truth and justice, bring to us Your peace and love.  </p>
    <p> The ship You were sailing, arrived at our shores, to conquer this land, the pearl of the seas; But you had decided, to stay in our soil; To conquer our people, and give us a name.  (Repeat Chorus) </p>
   
   <p>CONCLUDING PRAYER</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> O miraculous Santo Nino prostrate before your sacred Image,  we beseech you to cast a merciful look on our troubled hearts. Let Your tender love, so inclined to pity, be softened at our prayers, and grant us that grace for which  we ardently implore you. Take from us all unbearable affliction and despair. For your sacred infancy's sake hear our prayers and send us consolation and aid that  we may praise you, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen. </p>
    
    <p style="color:darkturquoise;"> History Of The Devotion To The Infant Of Prague </p>
    <p style="color:darkturquoise;"> Devotion to the Infant Jesus is as old as Christianity itself. It ever tends to keep the great mystery of Our Lord's birth vividly before us.</p>
    <p style="color:darkturquoise;"> A special devotion to the Divine Child originated with the Carmelites in the City of Prague, Bohemia, in the beginning of the seventeenth century. Princes Polyxedia of Lobkowitz had received, as a wedding gift from her mother, a statue of the Divine Child, previously brought from Spain. After the death of her husband, the princes devoted herself to works of charity and was particularly helpful to the Carmelites in Prague. When in 1628 the Carmelite Monastery had been reduce to poverty, owing to the ravages of war, the princes gave her precious statue to the Carmelites, saying: </p>
    <p style="color:tomato;"> "I GIVE YOU WHAT YOU PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IN THE WORLD; HONOR AND RESPECT THE CHILD JESUS AND YOU SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT." </p>
    <p style="color:darkturquoise;"> Her gift was placed in the Carmelite oratory.  The words of the princess proved prophetic for as long as the Carmelites kept up their devotion to the Divine Infant of Prague everything prospered with them. The Carmelites were later forced to flee form the city and in the confusion of the war, they were unable to take with them their miraculous statue. The invaders siezed it, and threw it into a pile of rubbish. In 1635, peace came to Prague and the Carmelites returned.  One of them, Father Cyril, who had previously received great spiritual help through his devotion to the Infant of Prague, sought the statue, and found it amidst the rubbish. Overjoyed, he placed the statue again in the oratory. As Father Cyril was one day praying devoutedly before the statue, he heard a voice saying:</p>
    <p style="color:tomato;"> "HAVE MERCY ON ME AND I WILL HAVE MERCY ON YOU. RETURN MY HANDS TO ME AND I SHALL GIVE YOU PEACE.  THE MORE YOU HONOR ME, THE MORE I SHALL BLESS YOU."</p>
    
    <p style="color:darkturquoise;"> Startled by these words, Father Cyril examined the statue and upon drawing aside the mantle covering it, he found that both hands of the statue were broken off. The hands were restored to the statue through the generosity of a client of the Divine Child. Once more, peace and prosperity returned to the Carmelites. </p>
