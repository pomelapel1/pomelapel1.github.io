    <p style="color:darkred;"> 1Praise awaits You, our God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 2You who answer prayers, to you all people will come. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 3When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 4Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 5You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> God our Savior,the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 6who formed the mountains by your power,  having armed yourself with strength, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 7who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 8The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 9You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly.   </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> for so you have ordained it.   </p>
   
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 10You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 11You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 12The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 13The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing! </p> <p>&nbsp</p>  <p&emsp></p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Psalm 126 - Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 1 When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> We were like those who dream. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> And our tongue with joyful shouting;  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Then they said among the nations, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> "The LORD has done great things for them." </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 3 The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 4 Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 5 Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 6 He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy,  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> bringing his sheaves with him. </p>

    <p style="color:red;">  <b>Holy Spirit, </b>you who make me see everything and show me the way to reach my ideals. You who give me the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to me and you who are in all instances of my life with me.  I, in this short dialogue want to thank you for everything, and confirm once more that I never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. I want to be with you and my loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> <b>Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help</b> </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that I may ever invoke your powerful name, the protection of the living and the salvation of the dying. O Purest Mary! O sweetest Mary! let your name henceforth be ever on my lips. Delay not, Blessed Lady, to succour me whenever I call on you. In all my temptations, in all my needs, I will never cease to call on you, ever repeating your sacred name, Mary, Mary. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh what a consolation, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fills my soul when I utter your sacred name or even only think of you! I thank the Lord for having given you so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But I will not be content with merely uttering your name. Let my love for you prompt me ever to hail you Mother of Perpetual 
    Help. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for me and grant me the favor I confidently ask of you (mention request here). </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Hail Mary (3x) </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:black;"> When needing an answer to prayers quickly and without delay, Mother Teresa of Calcutta famously prayed a “Flying” novena. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> This is a simple and quick way to pray a ‘novena’ when you don’t have the full nine days! How do you pray this novena?  Well, Mother Teresa would pray the, <b>Memorare prayer nine times in a row </b> rather than praying it once a day for 9 days.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">  Her religious sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, continue this practice today. Of course, you can pray it either way. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will, and the Devil was never capable to tie you around with his confusion. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and, full of kindness and patience you gave us example of how to untie the knots of our life. And by remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order, and make clearer the ties that link us to the Lord.

You know very well how desperate we are, our pain, and how we are bound by these knots.

    <p style="color:teal;"> Most watchful Guardian of the Holy Family, protect the chosen people of Jesus Christ; keep far from us, most loving father, all blight of error and corruption; mercifully assist us from heaven, most mighty defender, in this our conflict with the powers of darkness; and, even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the supreme peril of His life, so now defend God’s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity; keep us one and all under thy continual protection, that we may be supported by thine example and thine assistance, may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in heaven.

I beg of you, obtain that same protection and guidance for us and those dear to us during these times of dire distress. In your tender charity, watch over our country and those who are serving it. Obtain courage and strength for their loved ones. On earth your heart overflowed with compassion for those in danger or distress.

    <p style="color:brown;"> Blessed be God in His Angels and in His Saints. O Holy St. Anthony, gentlest of Saints, your love for God and Charity for His creatures made you worthy, when on earth, to possess miraculous powers. Miracles waited on your word, which you were ever ready to speak for those in trouble or anxiety. Encouraged by this thought, we implore of you to obtain for us (request). The answer to our prayer may require a miracle. Even so, you are the saint of Miracles.   O gentle and loving St. Anthony, whose heart was ever full of human sympathy, whisper our petition into the ears of the Sweet Infant Jesus, who loved to be folded in your arms, and the gratitude of our heart will ever be yours.  Amen.  </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:grey;"> <b> Saint Augustine, </b> great Bishop of Hippo and Doctor of the Church, may your life of conversion to the Catholic Faith be an example to both those who have never been apart of the Church, and to those who have fallen away from Christ's Church. Through your closeness with Our Lord in Heaven, intercede for us and bring to the One True Faith the following people (mention names). </p>

    <p style="color:grey;"> May your conversion centuries ago continue to inspire those who are lost today and with the help of your prayers, may God bring them to a full understanding of the Faith.

    <p style="color:grey;"> Oh God, hear the prayer of your servant, St Augustine, and bring the message of salvation to all who seek you in sincerity. Amen.  Our Father… Hail Mary… Glory Be…   St. Augustine, Pray For Us!  Amen. </p> <p>&nbsp</p>


    <p style="color:Tomato;"><b> Prayer to St. Monica </b></p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, under the weight of my heartful burden, I turn to you, dear Saint Monica and request your assistance and intercession.  From your place in heaven, I beg that you will plead before the Throne of the Holy One,  for the sake of my child, [Name],  who has wandered from the faith, and all that we have tried to teach.  I know, dear Monica, that our children belong not to us, but to God, and that God often permits this wandering as part of one’s journey toward Him. </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Your son, Augustine, wandered, too; eventually he found the faith, and came to believe, and in that belief became a true teacher.  Help me, therefore, to have patience, and to believe that all things — even this disappointing movement away from the faith — work ultimately to His own good purposes.  For the sake of my child’s soul, I pray to understand and trust in this.  St. Monica, please teach me to persist in faithful prayer as you did for your son’s sake.  </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Inspire me to behave in ways that will not further distance my child from Christ, but only draw [Name] gently towards his marvelous light.  Please teach me what you know about this painful mystery of separation, and how it is reconciled in the re-orientation of our children toward heaven. </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> O Saint Monica, lover of Christ and His Church, pray for me, and for my child [Name], that we may acquire heaven, joining with you, there, in offering constant and thankful  praise to God,  Amen. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> <b>St. Mary Goretti </b></p>
    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> Saint Mary Goretti who, strengthened by God's grace, did not hesitate, even at the age of twelve, to shed your blood and sacrifice life itself to defend your virginal purity, look graciously on the unhappy human race, which has strayed far from the path of eternal salvation. Teach us all, and especially youth, with what courage and  promptitude we should flee for the love of Jesus, anything that could offend Him or stain our souls with sin.</p>

    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> Obtain for us from our Lord victory in temptation, comfort in the sorrows of life, and the grace which we earnestly beg of Thee, [State your intention here...]  and may we one day enjoy with Thee  the imperishable glory of heaven. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

     
    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> Oh, St. John Paul, from the window of heaven, grant us your blessing! Bless the church that you loved and served and guided, courageously leading it along the paths of the world in order to bring Jesus to everyone and everyone to Jesus. Bless the young, who were your great passion. Help them dream again, help them look up high again to find the light that illuminates the paths of life here on earth.</p>

    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> May you bless families, bless each family! You warned of Satan's assault against this precious and indispensable divine spark that God lit on earth. St. John Paul, with your prayer, may you protect the family and every life that blossoms from the family.</p>

    <p style="color:deepskyblue;"> Pray for the whole world, which is still marked by tensions, wars and injustice. You tackled war by invoking dialogue and planting the seeds of love: pray for us so that we may be tireless sowers of peace.</p>

    <p style="color:deepskyblue;">Oh St. John Paul, from heaven's window, where we see you next to Mary, send God's blessing down upon us all.  Amen.</p><p>&nbsp</p>

Amen. </p>
