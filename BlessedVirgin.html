    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will, and the Devil was never capable to tie you around with his confusion. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and, full of kindness and patience you gave us example of how to untie the knots of our life. And by remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order, and make clearer the ties that link us to the Lord. Holy Mother, Mother of God, and our Mother, to you, who untie with motherly heart the knots of our life, we pray to you to receive in your hands </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> and to free them of the knots and confusion with which our enemies attack. Through your grace, your intercession, and your example, deliver us from all evil, Our Lady, and untie the knots that prevent us from being tied with God, so that we, free from sin and error, may find Him in all things, may have our hearts placed in Him, and may serve Him always in our brothers and sisters. Amen.   </p>

    <p style="color:darkbrown;"> [Our family here and abroad, our elderly, our livelihood, our health , the children & their studies, their choices, perspectives, chastity, purity, holiness, & my nieces nephews, their friends and all of the youth & the dying . . . ]  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> I beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all. You are our hope. O our Lady, you are the only consolation God gives me, the fortification of our feeble strength, the enrichment of our destitution, and, with Christ, the freedom from our chains. Hear our plea. Keep me, guide me, protect me, O safe refuge!  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;">Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Amen.  </p>

    <h3 id="Memorare">The Memorare </h3>
      <p>  Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided. </p>

      <p>Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.  Amen.  </p>   

    <h3 id="Fatima_Prayer">Fatima Prayers </h3>
      <p>  My God, I believe, I adore, I hope and I love Thee! I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love Thee.  </p>
      <p>Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—I adore Thee profoundly. I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges, and indifferences whereby He is offended. And through the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners. </p>  
      <p>O My Jesus, it is  for the  love of Thee, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for the sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.</p> 

    <h3 id="ClosingStJoseph">Closing Prayer to St. Joseph </h3>
      <p>Oh St. Joseph whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires. Oh St. Joseph do assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your divine son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, our Lord; so that having engaged here below your heavenly power I may offer my thanksgiving and homage to the most loving of fathers. Oh St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms. I dare not approach while he reposes near your heart. Press him in my name and kiss his fine head for me, and ask him to return the kiss when I draw my dying breath. St. Joseph, patron of departing souls, pray for us.  Amen.</p>

    <h3 id="ActofContrition">Act of Contrition</h3>
    <p>O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishments, but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin.

    <h3 id="SevenSorrows">The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Mother</h3>
    <p> 1. I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.</p>

    <p>7. I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.</p>
