      <p>Inspired by this confidence, we fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do we come, before thee we stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer us.  Amen.  </p>

      <p>Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son and Holy Spirit— we adore Thee profoundly. We offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges, and indifferences whereby He is offended. And through the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, we beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners. </p>

Oh St. Joseph, we never weary  of contemplating thee as  Jesus asleep in your arms. We dare not approach while he reposes near your heart. Press him in our name and kiss his fine head for us, and ask him to return the kiss when we draw our dying breath. St. Joseph, patron of departing souls, pray for us.  Amen.</p>

      We firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess our sins, to do penance and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
