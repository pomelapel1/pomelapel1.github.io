    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Pray the Psalm 23 </p><p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> <b>Psalm 65 – Thanksgiving for the Lord's Blessings </p></b>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 1Praise awaits You, our God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.</p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 2You who answer prayers, to you all people will come. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 3When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 4Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 5You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> God our Savior,the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 6who formed the mountains by your power,  having armed yourself with strength, </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 7who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 8The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 9You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly.   </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> for so you have ordained it.   </p>
   
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 10You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 11You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 12The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness. </p>
    <p style="color:darkred;"> 13The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing! </p> <p>&nbsp</p>  <p&emsp></p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Psalm 126 - Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 1 When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> We were like those who dream. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> And our tongue with joyful shouting;  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Then they said among the nations, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> "The LORD has done great things for them." </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 3 The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 4 Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 5 Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting. </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> 6 He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed, </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy,  </p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> bringing his sheaves with him. </p>

    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:red;">  <b>Holy Spirit, </b>you who make us see everything and show us the way to reach our ideals. You who give us the divine gift to forgive and forget the wrong that is done to us and you who are in all instances of our lives with us.  In this short dialogue, we want to thank you for everything, and confirm once more that we never want to be seperated from you, no matter how great the material desires may be. We want to be with you and our loved ones in your perpetual glory. Amen </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> <b>Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help</b> </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that we may ever invoke your powerful name, the protection of the living and the salvation of the dying. O Purest Mary! O sweetest Mary! let your name henceforth be ever on our lips. Delay not, Blessed Lady, to succour us whenever we call on you. In all our temptations, in all our needs, we will never cease to call on you, ever repeating your sacred name, Mary, Mary. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Oh what a consolation, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fill our souls when we utter your sacred name or even only think of you! We thank the Lord for having given you so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But we will not be content with merely uttering your name. Let our love for you prompt us ever to hail you Mother of Perpetual 
    Help. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for us and grant us the favor we confidently ask of you (mention request here). </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Hail Mary (3x) </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:black;"> When needing an answer to prayers quickly and without delay, Mother Teresa of Calcutta famously prayed a “Flying” novena. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> This is a simple and quick way to pray a ‘novena’ when you don’t have the full nine days! How do you pray this novena?  Well, Mother Teresa would pray the, <b>Memorare prayer nine times in a row </b> rather than praying it once a day for 9 days.</p>

    <p style="color:black;">  Her religious sisters, the Missionaries of Charity, continue this practice today. Of course, you can pray it either way. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <h3 id="StJude">Prayer to Saint Jude, Help of the Hopeless</h3>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Most holy apostle Saint Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the Church honors and invokes you universally as the patron of difficult cases and problems almost despaired of, pray for us, for we are so helpless and alone. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Intercede with God for us that He brings visible and speedy help where help is most needed. Come to our assistance in this great need that we may receive the consolation and help of heaven in all our necessities, tribulations, and sufferings, particularly (State Your Request), that we may praise God with you and all the saints forever. We promise, O Blessed Saint Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor granted to us  by God and to always honor you as our special and powerful patron, and to gratefully encourage devotion to you. Amen. </p>
    

    <h3 id="StRita">Prayer to Saint Rita for Hopeless Cases and In Distress</h3>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O Holy Patroness of those in need, St. Rita, whose pleadings before thy Divine Lord are almost irresistible, who for thy lavishness in granting favors hast been called the Advocate of the Hopeless and even of the Impossible; St. Rita, so humble, so pure, so mortified, so patient and of such compassionate love for thy Crucified Jesus that thou couldst obtain from Him whatsoever thou askest, on account of which all confidently have recourse to thee expecting, if not always relief, at least comfort; be propitious to our petition, showing thy power with God on behalf of thy suppliant; be lavish to us, as thou hast been in so many wonderful cases, for the greater glory of God, for the spreading of thine own devotion, and for the consolation of those who trust in thee.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O holy protectress of those who art in greatest need, thou who shineth as a star of hope in the midst of darkness, blessed Saint Rita, bright mirror of God's grace, in patience and fortitude thou art a model of all the states in life.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> We unite our will with the will of God through the merits of our Savior Jesus Christ, and in particular through his patient wearing of the crown of thorns, which with tender devotion thou didst daily contemplate.  </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Through the merits of the holy Virgin Mary and thine own graces and virtues, We ask thee to obtain our earnest petition, provided it be for the greater glory of God and my own sanctification.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Guide and purify my intention, O holy protectress and advocate, so that I may obtain the pardon of all my sins and the grace to persevere daily, as thou didst in walking with courage, generosity, and fidelity down the path of life. [Mention 
your request.] </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> We promise, if our petition is granted, to glorify thee by making known thy favor, to bless and sing thy praises forever. Relying then upon thy merits and power before the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we pray thee grant that [here mention your request]. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Saint Rita, advocate of the impossible, pray for us.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Saint Rita, advocate of the helpless, pray for us. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Recite the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be three times each. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the singular merits of thy childhood, Obtain for us our request.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy perfect union with the Divine Will, Obtain for us our request. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy heroic sufferings during thy married life, Etc. [repeat Obtain for us our request after each line] </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the consolation thou didst experience at the conversion of thy husband, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the sacrifice of thy children rather than see them grievously offend God,</p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the miraculous entrance into the convent, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By thy severe penances and thrice daily bloody scourgings,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the suffering caused by the wound thou didst receive from the thorn of thy Crucified Savior, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the Divine love which consumed thy heart, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By that remarkable devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, on which alone thou didst exist for four years, </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the happiness with which thou didst part from thy trials to join thy Divine Spouse,  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> By the perfect example thou gavest to people of every state of life.  </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Pray for us, O holy St. Rita, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> LET US PRAY. </p>
    <p style="color:darkblue;"> O God, Who in Thine infinite tenderness hast vouchsafed to regard the prayer of Thy servant, Blessed Rita, and dost grant to her supplication that which is impossible to human foresight, skill and efforts, in reward of her compassionate love and firm reliance on Thy promise, have pity on our adversity and succor us in our calamities, that the unbeliever may know Thou art the recompense of the humble, the defense of the helpless, and the strength of those who trust in Thee, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen. </p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;"> Good Saint Dymphna, great wonder-worker in every affliction of mind and body, I humbly implore your powerful intercession with Jesus through Mary, the Health of the Sick, in my present need.

    <p style="color:red;"><b>O HOLY SPIRIT,</b> Third Person of the Blessed Trinity! Spirit of Truth, Love and Holiness, proceeding from the Father and the Son, and equal to Them in all things!  We adore Thee and love Thee with all our hearts.  Teach us to know and to seek God, by whom and for whom we were created.  Fill our hearts with Holy Fear and Love of God.

    <p style="color:red;"> <b>ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT </b></p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;"> On our knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, we offer ourselves, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. We adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength and Light of our soul. In You we live and move and are. We desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and we pray with all our hearts to be kept from the smallest sin against You.

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> <b>Virgin Mary, Untier of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:Dodgerblue;"> Holy Mary, full of God’s presence during the days of your life, you accepted with full humility the Father’s will, and the Devil was never capable to tie you around with his confusion. Once with your Son you interceded for our difficulties, and, full of kindness and patience you gave us example of how to untie the knots of our life. And by remaining forever Our Mother, you put in order, and make clearer the ties that link us to the Lord. Holy Mother, Mother of God, and our Mother, to you, who untie with motherly heart the knots of our life, we pray to you to receive in your hands </p>
    <p style="color:DarkBlue;"> (Our family here and abroad, our elderly, our livelihood, our health , the children, my nieces and nephews & their studies, their choices, perspectives, chastity, purity, holiness,  their friends and all of the youth & young adults.  Save the children, Lord.  Save the children!  Don't let the grip of Satan, destroy them!  We also pray  for the conversion of sinners, to end war, sick & the dying, souls in purgatory of our parents, grandparents down to the first generation, relatives & most especially those who have been forgotten and stayed there the longest. . . ),  </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> and to free them of the knots and confusion with which our enemies attack. Through your grace, your intercession, and your example, deliver us from all evil, Our Lady, and untie the knots that prevent us from being tied with God, so that we, free from sin and error, may find Him in all things, may have our hearts placed in Him, and may serve Him always in our brothers and sisters. Amen.   </p>  <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><b> Prayer to Mary, Undoer of Knots </b> </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine love and immense mercy that exist in your heart, cast your compassionate eyes upon us and see the snarl of knots that exists in our life. You know very well how desperate we are, our pain, and how we are bound by these knots. Mary, Mother to whom God entrusted the undoing of the knots in the lives of his children, we entrust into your hands the ribbon of our life. No one, not even the evil one himself, can take it away from your precious care. In your hands there is no knot that cannot be undone. Powerful Mother, by your grace and intercessory power with Your Son and our Liberator, Jesus, take into your hands today this knot (mention your request) </p>

    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> I beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all. You are our hope. O our Lady, you are the only consolation God gives me, the fortification of our feeble strength, the enrichment of our destitution, and, with Christ, the freedom from our chains. Hear our plea. Keep me, guide me, protect me, O safe refuge! </p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Amen.  </p><p>&nbsp</p>

O St. Joseph do assist us by your powerful intercession and obtain for us from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, Our Lord; so that having engaged here below your Heavenly power, we may offer our thanksgiving and homage to the Loving of Fathers. O St. Joseph, we never weary of contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms. We dare not approach you while He reposes near your heart. Press him in our name and kiss His fine Head for me, and ask Him to return the kiss when we draw our dying breath. St. Joseph, Patron of departing souls, pray for us. Amen </p> <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p style="color:teal;"> Say for nine consecutive mornings for anything you may desire. It has seldom been known to fail. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Virgin Mary, that never has it been known that anyone who asked for your help and sought your intercession was left unaided. Full of confidence in your power, I hasten to you, and beg your protection. Listen, O foster-father of the Redeemer, to my humble prayer, and in your goodness hear and answer me. Amen. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> Saint Joseph, father and guardian of virgins, to whose faithful keeping Christ Jesus, innocence itself, and Mary, the virgin of virgins was entrusted, I pray and beseech you by that twofold and most precious charge, by Jesus and Mary, to save us from all uncleanness, to keep our minds untainted, our hearts pure, and our bodies chaste and to help us to serve Jesus and Mary in perfect chastity. Amen. </p><p>&nbsp</p>

    <p style="color:teal;"> TO thee, O blessed Joseph, do we have recourse in our tribulation, and having implored the help of thy thrice-holy Spouse, we confidently invoke thy patronage also.

    <p style="color:teal;"> Most watchful Guardian of the Holy Family, protect the chosen people of Jesus Christ; keep far from us, most loving father, all blight of error and corruption; mercifully assist us from heaven, most mighty defender, in this our conflict with the powers of darkness; and, even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the supreme peril of His life, so now defend God’s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity; keep us one and all under thy continual protection, that we may be supported by thine example and thine assistance, may be enabled to lead a holy life, die a happy death, and come at last to the possession of everlasting blessedness in heaven.

From your place in heaven, I beg that you will plead before the Throne of the Holy One,  for the sake of my child, [Name],  who has wandered from the faith, and all that we have tried to teach.  I know, dear Monica, that our children belong not to us, but to God, and that God often permits this wandering as part of one’s journey toward Him. </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Your son, Augustine, wandered, too; eventually he found the faith, and came to believe, and in that belief became a true teacher.  Help me, therefore, to have patience, and to believe that all things — even this disappointing movement away from the faith — work ultimately to His own good purposes.  For the sake of my child’s soul, I pray to understand and trust in this.  St. Monica, please teach me to persist in faithful prayer as you did for your son’s sake.  </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> Inspire me to behave in ways that will not further distance my child from Christ, but only draw [Name] gently towards his marvelous light.  Please teach me what you know about this painful mystery of separation, and how it is reconciled in the re-orientation of our children toward heaven. </p>

    <p style="color:Tomato;"> O Saint Monica, lover of Christ and His Church, pray for me, and for my child [Name], that we may acquire heaven, joining with you, there, in offering constant and thankful  praise to God,  Amen. </p><p>&nbsp</p>
